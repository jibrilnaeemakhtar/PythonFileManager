# PythonFileManager
File Manager created in Python, with a GUI

This program allows you to handle files in your system using alternate means, with direct access to functions such as 'Rename', 'Delete' and 'List All Files in Folder'



Issues:
- Having an issue importing easygui module
- Defined functions cannot be found when the last bit of code is run
- Window appearance is incorrect
- Only two buttons appear instead of all
